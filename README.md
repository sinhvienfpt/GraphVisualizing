A simple program reads the Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List, or Edge List and draws a graph from it.





I'm studying graphs and see that we can't study them well if we don't have a visual sample graph.

How to use it? 
  		
		1. Install all files
  		2.Use my default file path or you can use yours (you can also change the data in my files)
  		3.Run main.py and choose the option
I hope you enjoy it! Thanks
Any problem you can contact with my email hoangziet22@gmail.com, I really appreciate that.
